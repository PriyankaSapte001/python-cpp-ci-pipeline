# DevOps CI Demo

This project showcases:
- Python scripting and testing with `pytest`
- C++ build using CMake
- Cross-language CI with GitHub Actions

Iâ€™ve created a GitHub project with both a Python and C++ component. 
It uses GitHub Actions to run unit tests in multiple Python versions and builds a C++ executable with CMake on Ubuntu.
This shows I can set up basic pipelines, test automation, and cross-language workflows, which directly relates to the DevOps tasks in this role.
